- ðŸ‘‹ Yop everyone! I'm Thomas Lamoly, an ordinary person with a passion for web and mobile development, a field that interests me for its aesthetic and functional side, 
but also helps some companies to get known. 
I am a beginner in this field and still learning, I would like to increase my skills and reach a high enough level to be independent.
